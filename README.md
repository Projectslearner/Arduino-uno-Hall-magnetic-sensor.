### Hall Effect Sensor with LED Indicator

#### Project Overview

This project utilizes a Hall Effect sensor to detect the presence of a magnetic field and provides visual feedback using an LED indicator. When a magnetic field is detected, the LED turns on, and when no magnetic field is present, the LED turns off.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Board**
2. **Hall Effect Sensor**
3. **LED**
4. **Resistor (if required for LED)**
5. **Breadboard**
6. **Jumper Wires**

#### Circuit Wiring

1. **Hall Effect Sensor:**
   - Connect the Hall Effect sensor's signal pin to digital pin 2 on the Arduino.
   - Enable the internal pull-up resistor for the signal pin.

2. **LED:**
   - Connect the anode (longer leg) of the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino through a current-limiting resistor (if necessary).

#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Assemble the circuit according to the wiring instructions.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and components are correctly placed on the breadboard.

2. **Observe the Sensor Readings:**
   - When a magnetic field is detected, the LED will turn on.
   - When no magnetic field is detected, the LED will turn off.

#### Applications

- **Proximity Sensing:** Use the Hall Effect sensor for proximity sensing in various applications.
- **Magnetic Field Detection:** Detect the presence of magnetic fields for security or automation purposes.
- **Position Sensing:** Utilize the sensor for position sensing in robotics or industrial automation.
