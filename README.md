# Arduino Uno Hall Magnetic Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a Hall effect magnetic sensor with an Arduino Uno to detect the presence of a magnetic field. The sensor outputs a digital signal which is read by the Arduino. When a magnetic field is detected, the sensor outputs a low signal; otherwise, it outputs a high signal. The result is displayed on the serial monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Hall Effect Magnetic Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Hall Effect Sensor to Arduino Uno:**
   - **Vcc pin of the Hall Effect Sensor:** Connect to 5V on the Arduino Uno.
   - **GND pin of the Hall Effect Sensor:** Connect to GND on the Arduino Uno.
   - **Signal pin of the Hall Effect Sensor:** Connect to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Uno.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the Hall effect sensor to the Arduino Uno as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Bring a magnet close to the Hall effect sensor and observe the serial monitor output displaying the sensor state.

#### Applications

- **Security Systems:** Detecting magnetic field interruptions in doors and windows.
- **Automotive:** Monitoring the position of rotating components like wheels and crankshafts.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Used in devices to detect lid closures or other similar movements.

#### Notes

- Ensure the Hall effect sensor is correctly connected to the Arduino Uno and powered.
- The sensor outputs a low signal when a magnetic field is detected and a high signal when no magnetic field is detected.
- Adjust the code if necessary to fit your specific application requirements.
